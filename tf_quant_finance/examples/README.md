# Example Notebooks

Examples demonstrating usage of TFF methods.


In order to start the examples on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), please follow the link "Run in Google Colab" provided with the examples. To run the code without
issues, connect to a GPU runtime (Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Choose
GPU in Hardware accelerator section).

To experiment with custom VM instances and the latest GPU accelerators, consider running this on [AI Platform Notebooks](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform-notebooks/).

# TensorFlow training

If you are not familiar with TensorFlow, a good place to get started is with the
following self-study introduction to TensorFlow notebooks:
